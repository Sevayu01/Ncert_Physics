When a capacitor is connected to a voltage source in a DC circuit, current will flow for the short time required to charge the capacitor. As charge accumulates on the capacitor plates, the voltage across them increases, opposing the current. That is, a capacitor in a DC circuit will limit or oppose the current as it charges. When the capacitor is fully charged, the current in the circuit falls to zero."
