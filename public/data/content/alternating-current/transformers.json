One of the coils, called the primary coil, has $N_p$ turns. The other coil is called the secondary coil; it has $N_s$ turns. Often the primary coil is the input coil and the secondary coil is the output coil of the transformer."

The value of this emf depends on the number of turns in the secondary. We consider an ideal transformer in which the primary has negligible resistance and all the flux in the core links both primary and secondary windings. Let $\\phi$ be the flux in each turn in the core at time $t$ due to current in the primary when a voltage $v_p$ is applied to it. Then the induced emf or voltage $\\varepsilon_s$, in the secondary with $N_s$ turns is"

This type of arrangement is called a step-up transformer. However, in this arrangement, there is less current in the secondary than in the primary ($N_p/N_s < 1$ and $I_s < I_p$). For example, if the primary coil of a transformer has 100 turns and the secondary has 200 turns, $N_s/N_p = 2$ and $N_p/N_s = 1/2$. Thus, a 220 V input at 10 A will step up to 440 V output at 5.0 A."

The voltage output of generators is stepped up to reduce current (and consequently, $I^2R$ loss), making it suitable for long-distance transmission. It's then transmitted to area substations near consumers, where the voltage is stepped down. Further step-down occurs at distributing substations and utility poles before reaching homes with a power supply of 240 V."
