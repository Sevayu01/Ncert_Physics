Due to drift, there will be net transport of charges across any area perpendicular to $E$. Consider a planar area $A$ inside the conductor with the normal to the area parallel to $E$. Because of drift, in an infinitesimal amount of time $t$, all electrons to the left of the area at distances up to $|v_d| t$ would have crossed the area. If $n$ is the number of free electrons per unit volume in the metal, then there are $nt|v_d|A$ such electrons. Since each electron carries a charge $-e$, the total charge transported across this area $A$ to the right in time $t$ is $-neA|v_d|t$. Since $E$ is directed towards the left, the total charge transported along $E$ across the area is the negative of this. The amount of charge crossing the area $A$ in time $t$ is, by definition, $I t$, where $I$ is the magnitude of the current. Hence:"
