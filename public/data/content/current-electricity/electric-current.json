      "body": "Consider a small area perpendicular to the flow of charges. Both positive and negative charges can move back and forth across this area. Within a time interval $t$, let $q^+$ represent the net positive charge flowing forward across the area (forward minus backward), and similarly, let $q^-$ represent the net negative charge flowing forward. The total charge flowing forward across the area in time $t$ is then $q = q^+ - q^-$. For steady currents, this quantity is proportional to $t$, and the ratio $\\frac{q}{t}$ is defined as the current across the area in the forward direction (if it's negative, it indicates a backward current)."

Let $Q$ be the net charge flowing across a conductor's cross-section during the time $t$ (between $t$ and $t + \\Delta t$). Then, the current at time $t$ across the cross-section is the limit of the ratio $\\frac{Q}{\\Delta t}$ as $\\Delta t$ approaches zero:\\[ I(t) = \\lim_{\\Delta t \\to 0} \\frac{Q}{\\Delta t} \\]"

An ampere is typically the order of magnitude of currents in household appliances. Lightning, on average, carries currents of tens of thousands of amperes, while currents in nerves are in microamperes."
