While formulas for series and parallel combinations of resistors are helpful, they may not suffice to determine all currents and potential differences in a circuit. Kirchhoff's rules provide a powerful tool for analyzing electric circuits."

Similarly, for each cell, we label the positive and negative electrodes and the direction of current flow through the cell. This allows us to determine the potential difference,"
