      "body": "A capacitor consists of two conductors separated by an insulator. Picture two metal plates with a gap between them. When we connect these plates to a battery, one plate gains a positive charge (let's call it Q) and the other plate gains an equal negative charge (–Q). This creates a potential difference (V) between the plates."

      "name": "paragraph",
      "body": "Now, the capacitance (C) of a capacitor tells us how much charge it can hold for a given potential difference. It's like the capacity of a water tank. The bigger the tank, the more water it can hold for the same level of pressure."
    },
    {
      "name": "paragraph",
      "body": "The capacitance depends on the physical setup of the capacitor—how big the plates are, how far apart they are, and what kind of insulator is between them."
    },
    {
      "name": "paragraph",
      "body": "The key relationship is Q = CV, where Q is the charge, C is the capacitance, and V is the potential difference. This means if we increase the charge (Q) on the capacitor, the potential difference (V) increases proportionally."

    {
      "name": "paragraph",
      "body": "For example, if you have a big capacitor (high capacitance), it can hold a lot of charge without needing a high potential difference. This is useful because high potential differences can cause problems, like creating strong electric fields that can cause the charge to leak away."

This setup constitutes what we call a parallel plate capacitor.In this scenario, let's consider the plates to be in a vacuum, meaning there's no material between them except empty space. Later on, we'll discuss the effects of placing a dielectric material between the plates, but let's keep it simple for now."
