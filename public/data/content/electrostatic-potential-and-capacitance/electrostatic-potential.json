This work is directly proportional to q because the force at any point is qE, where E is the electric field due to the given charge setup. Thus, it's useful to divide the work by the amount of charge q, making the resulting quantity independent of q. In essence, the work done per unit test charge characterizes the electric field linked to the charge arrangement. This concept leads us to the idea of electrostatic potential V resulting from a particular charge setup."

We also discovered that the electric field of a dipole at a point depends not only on the distance r but also on the angle between r and p. Additionally, unlike the field due to a single charge, the field of a dipole falls off as 1/r^3 at large distances.
