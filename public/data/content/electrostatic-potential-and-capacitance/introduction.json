      "body": "When you lift a weight against gravity, it gains potential energy because of its position. As it falls, it gains kinetic energy and loses potential energy. The total energy remains constant. Forces like these are called conservative forces, like the spring force and gravity. The Coulomb force between stationary charges is also conservative. This isn't surprising because both forces depend on distance inversely and differ mainly in their constants. Like how a mass gains potential energy in a gravitational field, a charge gains electrostatic potential energy in an electrostatic field."

This scenario occurs when both Q and q are positive or negative. For simplicity, let's assume both are positive."

In that case, the electric force will propel q away from Q, using the stored potential energy to give q kinetic energy, keeping the total energy constant."

At each point in the electric field, a particle with charge q gains electrostatic potential energy. The work done increases its potential energy by an amount equal to the potential energy difference between points R and P. So, the potential energy difference (âˆ†U) from point R to point P is equal to the negative of the work done (W)."

This is a fundamental feature of conservative forces. If the work depended on the path, the concept of potential energy wouldn't make sense. The fact that the work done by an electrostatic field is independent of the path can be demonstrated using Coulomb's law."

This implies that the actual value of potential energy isn't physically significant; only the difference in potential energy matters. Adding an arbitrary constant to potential energy at every point won't change the potential energy difference.In simpler terms, we have the freedom to choose where the potential energy is considered zero. A convenient choice is to set the electrostatic potential energy to zero at infinity."
