The area around a charge where another charge feels aforce is called the electric field of that charge. In simpler terms, the electric field is like aninvisible area around a charge where other charges can feel a push or pull.The electric field is measured with both direction and strength. If it's a positive charge, thepush or pull is outward; for a negative charge, it's inward."

Moving Charges: Moving charges can feel a force from magnetic fields, but they can't helpus detect an electric field. Magnetic fields don't affect static charges.Force Direction: If you put a positive charge in an electric field, it feels a force in the samedirection as the field. A negative charge feels a force opposite to the field direction.Field Extends Infinitely: For every charge, there's an electric field that goes on forever. Thisfield isn't affected by other charges nearby.No Self-Force: A charged particle doesn't feel a force from its own electric field."
