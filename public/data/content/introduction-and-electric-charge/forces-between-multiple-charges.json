This is termed asthe principle of superposition. The principle of superposition says that in a system of charges\\( q_1 , q_2 , \\dots, q_n \\), the force on \\( q_1 \\) due to \\( q_2 \\) is the same as given byCoulomb's law, i.e., it is unaffected by the presence of the other charges \\( q_3 , q_4 , \\dots,q_n \\). The total force \\( \\mathbf{F_1} \\) on the charge \\( q_1 \\), due to all other charges, isthen given by the vector sum of the forces \\( \\mathbf{F_{12}}, \\mathbf{F_{13}}, \\dots,\\mathbf{F_{1n}} \\):"
