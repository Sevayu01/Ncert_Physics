Therefore, if $\\phi$ is total flux and $\\epsilon_0$ is electric constant, the total electric charge $Q$ enclosed by the surface is: \\[ Q=\\phi \\epsilon_0 \\] The Gauss law formula is expressed by: \\[ \\phi = \\frac{Q}{\\epsilon_0} \\] Where, Q=Total charge within the given surface \\\\ \\epsilon_0 & = \\text{The electric constant} \\end{align*}  \\documentclass{article} \\usepackage{amsmath} \\begin{document} \\section{The Gauss Theorem} The net flux through a closed surface is directly proportional to the net charge in the volume enclosed by the closed surface: \\[ \\Phi = \\oint \\mathbf{E} \\cdot d\\mathbf{A} = \\frac{q_{\\text{net}}}{\\epsilon_0} \\] In simple words, the Gauss theorem relates the 'flow' of electric field lines (flux) to the charges within the enclosed surface. If no charges are enclosed by a surface, then the net electric flux remains zero. This means that the number of electric field lines entering the surface equals the field lines leaving the surface.

Let's denote the charge on the sheet as $\\sigma$ (sigma). We'll use the x-axis as our guide, pointing straight away from the sheet. Due to the sheet's symmetry, the electric field will only depend on the x-axis and won't vary along the y or z directions. Now, imagine a special shape, like a rectangular box, around a part of the sheet. We call this our 'Gaussian surface', which helps us understand and visualize the field. The electric field lines are like invisible threads passing through the top and bottom faces of our box. The total number of threads passing through both faces is represented by $2EA$, where $E$ is the electric field strength and $A$ is the area of the faces. According to Gauss' law, $2EA$ equals the charge inside our box divided by a special constant $\\epsilon_0$ (epsilon naught): \\[ 2EA = \\frac{\\sigma A}{\\epsilon_0} \\] Therefore, the electric field $E$ is given by:\\[ E = \\frac{\\sigma}{2\\epsilon_0} \\]The direction of the electric field is normal to the plane of the sheet (see figure).Note: The electric field is uniform and does not depend on the exact spot ($x$) onthe sheet.

To understand the electric field outside the shell, we create a magic bubble around a point $P$ outside the sphere. This bubble is like an invisible force field, and it's a sphere too, with its center at the center of the charged shell. Electric field lines are like threads coming out from the shell. Picture these threads passing through the surface of our bubble. The total number of threads is given by: \\[ E \\times 4\\pi r^2 \\] Gauss, our magical physicist friend, tells us that this total thread count is related to the charge inside the shell: \\[ \\sigma \\times 4\\pi R^2 \\] where $\\sigma$ is the charge density on the shell, $\\epsilon_0$ is a special constant, and $E$ is the electric field. The threads (flux) equal the charge inside divided by a special constant $\\epsilon_0$. So, \\[ E \\times 4\\pi r^2 = \\frac{\\sigma \\times 4\\pi R^2}{\\epsilon_0} \\] At the surface of the shell, draw a Gaussian surface of radius $R$, \\[ q_{\\text{enclosed}} = \\sigma \\times 4\\pi r^2 \\] \\[ E_{p2} \\times 4\\pi r^2 = \\frac{q_{\\text{enclosed}}}{\\epsilon_0} \\] \\[ E_{p2} = \\frac{\\sigma \\times 4\\pi r^2}{4\\pi r^2 \\epsilon_0} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\epsilon_0} \\] For $r > R$: \\[ q_{\\text{enclosed}} = \\sigma \\times (4\\pi r^2) \\] \\[ E_{p3} \\times 4\\pi r^2 = \\frac{\\sigma \\times 4\\pi r^2}{\\epsilon_0} \\] \\[ E_{p3} = \\frac{\\sigma R^2}{\\epsilon_0 r^2} \\] Now, let's go inside the shell. Imagine standing at point $P$ inside the shell. We create another magic bubble. Gauss whispers that if there's no charge inside our bubble, the electric field inside is zero. It's like saying, 'If there's no magical glow inside, you won't feel anything'. Therefore, inside the shell, the electric field is zero: \\[ E = 0 \\]"
