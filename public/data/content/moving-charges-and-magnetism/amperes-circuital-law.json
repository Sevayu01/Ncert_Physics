      "body": "There is an alternative and appealing way in which the Biot-Savart law may be expressed. Ampere's circuital law considers an open surface with a boundary. The surface has current passing through it. We consider the boundary to be made up of a number of small line elements. Consider one such element of length \\( dl \\). We take the value of the tangential component of the magnetic field, \\( B_t \\), at this element and multiply it by the length of that element \\( dl \\) [Note: \\( B_t \\, dl = B \\cdot dl \\)]. All such products are added together. We consider the limit as the lengths of elements get smaller and their number gets larger. The sum then tends to an integral. "

Ampere's law is to the Biot-Savart law what Gauss's law is to Coulomb's law. Both Ampere's and Gauss's laws relate a physical quantity on the periphery or boundary (magnetic or electric field) to another physical quantity, namely, the source, in the interior (current or charge). We also note that Ampere's circuital law holds for steady currents which do not fluctuate with time. The following example will help us understand what is meant by the term enclosed current."
