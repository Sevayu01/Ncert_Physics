Additionally, an external magnetic field exerts a force on a current-carrying conductor, as per the Lorentz force formula. Consequently, it's reasonable to expect that two nearby current-carrying conductors would exert magnetic forces on each other. In the early 19th century, Ampère meticulously studied the nature of this magnetic force, considering factors such as current magnitude, conductor shape, size, and distance between conductors."
