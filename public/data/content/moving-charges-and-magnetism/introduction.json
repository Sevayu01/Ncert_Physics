      "body": "Both electricity and magnetism have been known for more than 2000 years. However, it was only about 200 years ago, in 1820, that it was realized that they were intimately related. During a lecture demonstration in the summer of 1820, Danish physicist Hans Christian Oersted noticed that a current in a straight wire caused a noticeable deflection in a nearby magnetic compass needle. He investigated this phenomenon and found that the alignment of the needle is tangential to an imaginary circle which has the straight wire as its center and has its plane perpendicular to the wire."

      "body": "Reversing the direction of the current reverses the orientation of the needle. The deflection increases with increasing current or bringing the needle closer to the wire. Iron filings sprinkled around the wire arrange themselves in concentric circles with the wire as the center. Oersted concluded that moving charges or currents produced a magnetic field in the surrounding space."

      "body": "Following this discovery, there was intense experimentation. In 1864, the laws obeyed by electricity and magnetism were unified and formulated by James Maxwell, who then realized that light was electromagnetic waves. Radio waves were discovered by Hertz, and produced by J.C. Bose and G. Marconi by the end of the 19th century. Remarkable scientific and technological progress took place in the 20th century due to our increased understanding of electromagnetism and the invention of devices for production, amplification, transmission, and detection of electromagnetic waves."

      "body": "In this chapter, we will explore how the magnetic field exerts forces on moving charged particles, like electrons, protons, and current-carrying wires. We will also learn how currents produce magnetic fields. Additionally, we will study how particles can be accelerated to very high energies in a cyclotron, and how currents and voltages are detected by a galvanometer."

A current or a field going into the plane of the paper is depicted by a cross ($\\times$)."
