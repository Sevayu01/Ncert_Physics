The concept of a field was specially stressed by Faraday and was incorporated by Maxwell in his unification of electricity and magnetism. In addition to depending on each point in space, it can also vary with time, i.e., be a function of time. In our discussions in this chapter, we will assume that the fields do not change with time."

It has several basic properties identical to the electric field. It is defined at each point in space (and can in addition depend on time). Experimentally, it is found to obey the principle of superposition: the magnetic field of several sources is the vector addition of the magnetic field of each individual source.Let us suppose that there is a point charge \\( q \\) (moving with a velocity \\( \\mathbf{v} \\) and located at \\( \\mathbf{r} \\) at a given time \\( t \\)) in the presence of both the electric field \\( \\mathbf{E}(\\mathbf{r}) \\) and the magnetic field \\( \\mathbf{B}(\\mathbf{r}) \\).

Dimensionally, we have \\([B] = [\\frac{F}{qv}]\\), and the unit of \\( \\mathbf{B} \\) is Newton second / (coulomb meter). This unit is called tesla (T), named after Nikola Tesla (1856 – 1943). Tesla is a rather large unit. A smaller unit (non-SI) called gauss (\\(=10^{-4}\\) tesla) is also often used. The Earth's magnetic field is about \\(3.6 \\times 10^{-5}\\) T."
