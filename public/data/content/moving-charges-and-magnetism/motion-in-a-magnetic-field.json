We have learned in Mechanics that a force on a particle does work if the force has a component along (or opposed to) the direction of motion of the particle. In the case of motion of a charge in a magnetic field, the magnetic force is perpendicular to the velocity of the particle. So no work is done and no change in the magnitude of the velocity is produced (though the direction of momentum may be changed). [Notice that this is unlike the force due to an electric field, ( $\\qmathbf{E}$ ), which can have a component parallel (or antiparallel) to motion and thus can transfer energy in addition to momentum."

The particle will describe a circle if $\\mathbf{v}$ and $\\mathbf{B}$ are perpendicular to each other."
