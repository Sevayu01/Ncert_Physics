Unlike temperature or pressure, electric fields involve both how strong the force is and in what direction it acts. So, we call electric fields vector fields(E)."

We put a tiny positive charge there (it's like a test charge), and then we measure how the electric force acts on this charge. This helps us understand the electric field around that charged object. At P, we place a particle with a small positive charge q0, called a test charge because we use it to test the field"
