Because of drift, in an infinitesimal amount of time $t$, all electrons to the left of the area at distances up to $|v_d| t$ would have crossed the area. If $n$ is the number of free electrons per unit volume in the metal, then there are $nt|v_d|A$ such electrons. Since each electron carries a charge $-e$, the total charge transported across this area $A$ to the right in time $t$ is $-neA|v_d|t$. Since $E$ is directed towards the left, the total charge transported along $E$ across the area is the negative of this.
